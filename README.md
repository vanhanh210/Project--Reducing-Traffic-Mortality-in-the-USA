# Project: Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA
 
For the "Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA" project, I have developed an effective strategy to decrease traffic-related deaths in the USA. This involves importing, cleaning, manipulating, and visualizing data. Additionally, I am performing feature engineering and applying various machine learning models, including multivariate linear regression and KMeans clustering, to derive state-level insights. The results of this analysis will be communicated clearly and effectively.
